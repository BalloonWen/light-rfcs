### Summary

The default implementation for the authentication is based on a database user table. It works for an isolated OAuth 2.0 provider. For enterprise-scale, the authentication providers need to be plugged in with service.yml so that we can leverage Active Directory, Azure or customer database table. 

For some plugins, reference implementations need to be provided to showcase how to start the integration.
